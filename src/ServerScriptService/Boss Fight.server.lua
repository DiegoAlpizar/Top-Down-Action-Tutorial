--[[
	Manage our boss fight and transition between the two phases.
	This fight will consist of two phases. In the first phase, the player must defeat the robot wizards that are powering the bossâ€™s force field. After the wizards are gone, phase two starts, and the boss starts summoning robot summoners (who will in turn summon PiBots). If the player is able to defeat the boss in phase two, then they have won the game.
